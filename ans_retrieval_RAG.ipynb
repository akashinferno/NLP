(Pic credit: PTI)\\n\\nNEW DELHI: At least 11 people died and 33 others were injured as a stampede occurred at Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru after a large number of people gathered to participate in the RCB victory celebrations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident \"absolutely heartrending\" and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured people. Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah held a press conference and announced Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of those deceased. He also ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. How chaos & tragedy unfoldedWhat was meant to be a day of jubilation turned tragic as a massive crowd gathered to celebrate Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) first-ever Indian Premier League (IPL) title win. Scattered shoes, broken sandals, and torn pieces of sports jerseys littered the area, marking the aftermath of the chaos that unfolded when crowds spiralled out of control.Lakhs of young fans had converged outside the stadium with \"RCB\" chanting. Many were seen climbing trees, scaling walls, and clinging to poles in a desperate attempt to catch a glimpse of their cricketing idols.As excitement peaked, the situation turned dangerous.\\n\\nPeople began to fall, some losing consciousness. Panic spread quickly as the jubilant cheers turned into screams for help. Emergency services rushed the injured to nearby hospitals. Even amid the unfolding tragedy, groups of young fans were seen sitting atop compound walls near Saint Mark\\'s Cathedral, cheering for RCB as sirens wailed and police tried to restore order.Despite a heavy deployment of police personnel, the sheer scale of the crowd overwhelmed security arrangements. Officials acknowledged they were heavily outnumbered by the surging masses.\\'Absolutely heartrending,\\' says PM Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the stampede in Bengaluru as \"absolutely heartrending\". In a post on X, he said, \"The mishap in Bengaluru is absolutely heartrending. In this tragic hour, my thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that those who are injured have a speedy recovery.\"\\n\\nPresident Droupadi Murmu also expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in a stampede and called the incident \\'shocking and heartbreaking\\'. In a social media post on X, Droupadi Murmu wrote, \"The loss of lives in the tragic happening at a stadium in Bengaluru is shocking and heartbreaking. My condolences to the bereaved families and prayers for the speedy recovery of the injured.\"\\n\\nCM Siddaramaiah on stampede Chief minister Siddaramaiah, while addressing a press conference gave details of the incident, saying that 11 lives were lost and 33 others were reported injured. He added that the stadium has capacity of hosting 35,000 people, but around two or three lakh people gathered to witness the event, and the crowd was unexpected. \"11 are dead and 33 injured due to stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. More than 2-3 lakh people came, and no one expected this much crowd,\" Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said at a press conference.Further, the CM said that he would not justify the mishap but drew comparisons with similar tragedies elsewhere, like in Kumbh Mela, as BJP criticised his government for the tragedy.\\n\\n\\'50-60 people died in Kumbh Mela, did I or Karnataka govt criticise?,\\' says CM\"Such incidents happened in so many places. I am not going to defend this by comparing it with them now by saying it happened here and there. In Kumbh Mela, 50-60 people died, I didn\\'t criticise it,\" he said.\"If Congress criticises, then that is a different matter. Did I or the Karnataka government criticise?\" CM Siddaramaiah said.BCCI on RCB celebrations leading to death of fansThe BCCI called the incident shocking adding that the organisers should have been better-prepared.\"It\\'s most unfortunate, organisers should have planned RCB\\'s IPL-winning celebrations better,\" BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told PTI.\"When one organises a victory celebration of this magnitude, proper precautions and security measures need to be taken,\" he added.IPL chairman Arun Dhumal said, \"Whatever inquiry that needs to be done, the concerned authorities will do that. It was not a BCCI event. It is sad and tragic.\"\\n\\n\\'Fans thronged the venue\\'According to eyewitnesses, fans thronged the venue of felicitation. Visuals showed police shifting the injured persons and those who had fallen unconscious to ambulances.Cops were seen using mild force to manage the crowd outside stadium. They had a tough time in crowd management as a large number of cricket enthusiasts tried to gain entry, at the same time, into the stadium.According to a traffic advisory from the Bengaluru police, entry to Chinnaswamy Stadium was limited to only those with valid tickets and passes. \"As there is limited parking facility available near the Chinnaswamy Stadium, those who are attending the event are advised to use public transport and Metro. The public is requested to cooperate,\" it had said.Karnataka BJP President BY Vijayendra arrived at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital to meet the injured people. \\'They were more interested in publicity,\\' BJP slams state government over preparedness \"The state government should take full responsibility for this tragedy. When the whole country and Karnataka were celebrating RCB\\'s victory, the state government\\'s haste to hold a victory rally without any prior preparations led to this tragedy. The state government never cared about prior preparations. They were more interested in publicity. This resulted in the death of more than 11 people. Some people are in ICU. I spoke to some victims, there was no police inside, no ambulance facility. The CM should send the matter for judicial investigation,\" Vijayendra said. The IPL champions and several political leaders, including Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah marked their presence at the victory parade.Also read: Tragedy at RCB\\'s IPL 2025 victory parade: KSCA, franchise break silence on stamped\\n\\nauthor\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n\\nTOI News Desk\\n\\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won't stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet's use this moment to reset. Let's stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet's stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can't change how divided we've been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who'd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I've always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I'm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia's economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what's happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt's based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: What did the Prime Minister Narendra Modi tell about the RCB  Stampede issue\\n=========\\nContent: Mishap in Bengaluru is absolutely heartrending: PM Modi\\nSource: https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rcb-ipl-victory-parade-stampede-death-toll-virat-kohli-chinnaswamy-stadium-live/article69656707.ece\\n\\nContent: There is no information provided in the given text about what Prime Minister Narendra Modi said regarding the RCB stampede.\\nSource: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengaluru-chinnaswamay-stadium-stampede-several-people-died-injured-rcb-victory-parade-karnataka-cm-siddaramaiah-latest-news/articleshow/121623434.cms\\n\\nContent: There is no mention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi or his statements regarding the RCB stampede in the provided text.\\nSource: https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rcb-ipl-victory-parade-stampede-death-toll-virat-kohli-chinnaswamy-stadium-live/article69656707.ece\\n\\nContent: There is no information in the provided text about what Prime Minister Narendra Modi said regarding the RCB stampede.\\nSource: https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rcb-ipl-victory-parade-stampede-death-toll-virat-kohli-chinnaswamy-stadium-live/article69656707.ece\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\n",
